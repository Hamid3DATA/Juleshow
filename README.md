This is my school project for Christmas.

First things first you should download the website files from “[Website Files](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/Juleshow/tree/main/Website%20Files)” folder and then start a local webserver.
To host this site locally using raspberry pi you will need "Apache2". You can install it using

```
sudo apt install apache2
```

After you installed it you can go to ```/var/www/html/``` and put the website files in there. You can then access the site using raspberry pi's IP address in the browser.

If you want to do everything manually follow the “[Raspberry Pi – How to start website on boot.md](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/Juleshow/blob/main/Raspberry%20Pi%20-%20How%20to%20start%20website%20on%20boot.md)” file.

If you want everything to be done automatically follow the “[Automatic Raspberry Pi setup script.md](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/Juleshow/blob/main/Automatic%20Raspberry%20Pi%20setup%20script.md)” file.
