This is my school project for Christmas.

First things first you should download the website files from “Website Files” folder and then start a local webserver.
To host this site locally using raspberry pi you will need "Apache2". You can install it using

```
sudo apt install apache2
```

After you installed it you can go to /var/www/html/ and put the website files in there. Then you can access the site using raspberry pi's IP address.

If you want to do everything manually follow the “Raspberry Pi – How to start website on boot.md” file.

If you want everything to be done automatically you should follow the “Automatic Raspberry Pi setup script.md” file.
